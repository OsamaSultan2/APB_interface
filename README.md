# APB_interface
## APB_interface project
The APB protocol is a low-cost interface, optimized for minimal power consumption and reduced interface
complexity. The APB interface is not pipelined and is a simple, synchronous protocol. Every transfer takes at least
two cycles to complete.
The APB interface is designed for accessing the programmable control registers of peripheral devices. APB
peripherals are typically connected to the main memory system using an APB bridge. For example, a bridge from
AXI to APB could be used to connect a number of APB peripherals to an AXI memory system.
